## Hi, I'm Jaime 👋🏽

💻 I'm a full-stack software engineer building applications with TypeScript, React, Vue, Next.js, React Native, Node.js, and SQL/NoSQL databases.

👨🏽‍💻 I'm versed in and always learning more about ES6+ JavaScript, state management, containerization + CI/CD, and testing frameworks & utilities such as Jest and React Testing Library.

🧑🏽‍🏫 I'm passionate about crafting sleek, scalable products that support developers and solve problems. I most recently worked at CS Engineering, where I contributed to building innovative tools in the EdTech space used by over 200k people this past year.

📋 Last year, I worked with a team of engineers on OverVue, an open-source frontend prototyping/mockup tool that helps Vue developers streamline the conception and visualization of their app's component architecture.

🗣️ I recently gave a [public talk on TypeScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFhO8jRY6O0&ab_channel=JaimedeVenecia), sponsored by Jeeny + Bractlet for their Software Engineering Speaker Series.

🎶 ✈️ 🍱 Outside of engineering, I’m extremely passionate about music and am a [songwriter & producer](https://www.soundcloud.com/jdvplus) with hundreds of thousands of plays across multiple streaming platforms. I adore international travel and the hospitality industry – I’m constantly seeking new restaurants, bars, and countries to visit.

🤝🏽 I love connecting with other engineers, designers, and fellow creatives. Reach out to me!
