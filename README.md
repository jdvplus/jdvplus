### Hi, I'm Jaime 👋🏽

💻 I'm a full-stack software engineer building applications with React, Vue, TypeScript, Express/Node.js, and SQL/NoSQL databases.

👨🏽‍💻 I'm versed in and always learning more about ES6+ JavaScript, TypeScript, state management with Redux and Pinia, HTML + Sass/CSS/Tailwind, build tools, containerization + CI/CD, and testing frameworks & utilities such as Jest and React Testing Library.

🧑🏽‍🏫 I'm passionate about crafting sleek, scalable products that support developers and solve problems. I currently work at CS Engineering, where I've contributed to building innovative tools in the EdTech space used by over 200k people this past year.

📋 I recently worked with a talented team of engineers on OverVue, an open-source frontend prototyping/mockup tool that helps Vue developers streamline the conception and visualization of their app's component architecture.

🗣️ I gave a [public talk on TypeScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFhO8jRY6O0&ab_channel=JaimedeVenecia) earlier this year, sponsored by Jeeny + Bractlet for their Software Engineering Speaker Series.

🎶 Outside of engineering, I’m extremely passionate about music and am a [songwriter & producer](https://soundcloud.com/jdvplus) with hundreds of thousands of plays across multiple streaming platforms.

✈️🍱 I also love international travel and adore the hospitality industry – I’m constantly seeking new restaurants, bars, and countries to visit.

🤝🏽 I’m always happy connecting with other engineers, designers, and fellow creatives. Reach out any time!
