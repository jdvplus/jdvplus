## üëãüèΩ Hi, I'm Jaime

I'm a full-stack software engineer building applications with TypeScript, React, Vue, Next.js, React Native, Node.js, and SQL/NoSQL databases.

I'm passionate about crafting sleek, scalable products that improve our lives. I'm currently building a health & wellness iOS app that provides OpenAI-powered personalized health recommendations based on users' wearable data, medical records, diet logs, daily mood tracking, and more.

I recently worked at CS Engineering, where I contributed to building innovative tools in the EdTech space leveraged by over 200k people this past year.

Last year, I worked with a team of engineers on OverVue, an open-source desktop app that helps Vue developers prototype and conceptualize their app's component architecture prior to development.

Outside of engineering, I‚Äôm extremely passionate about music and am a [songwriter & producer](https://www.soundcloud.com/jdvplus) with hundreds of thousands of plays across multiple streaming platforms. I adore international travel and the hospitality industry ‚Äì I‚Äôm constantly seeking new restaurants, bars, and countries to visit.

I love connecting with other engineers, designers, and fellow creatives. Reach out to me!
