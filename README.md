### Hi, I'm Jaime! 👋🏽

💻 I'm a full-stack software engineer building applications in React, Vue, Express.js/Node.js, and SQL/NoSQL databases.

👨🏽‍💻 I'm versed in and always learning more about ES6+ JavaScript, TypeScript, Pinia, Redux, HTML + Sass/CSS, Webpack, and Jest.

📋 I most recently worked with a talented team of engineers on OverVue, an open source frontend prototyping tool meant to help Vue developers concept, visualize, and build their application architecture before & during the development process.

🗣️ I recently gave a [public talk on TypeScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFhO8jRY6O0&ab_channel=JaimedeVenecia), sponsored by Jeeny + Bractlet for their Software Engineering Speaker Series.

🎶 Outside of engineering, I’m extremely passionate about music and am a [songwriter & producer](https://soundcloud.com/jdvplus) with hundreds of thousands of plays across multiple streaming platforms.

✈️🍱 I also love international travel and adore the hospitality industry – I’m constantly seeking new restaurants, bars, and countries to visit.

🤝🏽 I’m always happy to connect with engineers, designers, and fellow creatives. Reach out any time!
